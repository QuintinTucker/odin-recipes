            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup mayonnaise, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon blue food coloring, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black food coloring, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place each egg, cut-side down, into a muffin cup paper liner.</li>
                <li>Spoon mayonnaise into a plastic resealable bag; snip 1 of the bottom corners of the bag. Pipe mayonnaise through the opening around the base of each egg half.</li>
                <li>Portion red food coloring into a small bowl, blue food coloring into a second small bowl, and black food coloring into a third small bowl. Dip a clean and sterile small-tip paintbrush into the red food coloring and paint small lines onto each egg to represent 'veins', making sure to get a little of the red food coloring into the mayonnaise.</li>
                <li>Rinse brush and make a blue circle on the top middle of each egg to represent the 'iris'. Rinse brush and paint a black ring around the iris and put a dot of black in the middle of the iris for the 'pupil'.</li>
            </ol>
