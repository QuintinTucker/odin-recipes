            This recipe involves turning ordinary hot dogs into creepy little spiders!

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
                <li>8 hot dogs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Unroll crescent dough. Pinch or press the perforation between the triangles to get 4 rectangular pieces. Cut rectangles in half lengthwise so you have 8 narrow strips.</li>
                <li>Make a 2-inch slice through the center of one end of a hot dog. Cut two more 2-inch slices on either side of that, so that the 'legs' are about the same thickness. Repeat on the other end. Cut 'legs' into the remaining hot dogs.</li>
                <li>Roll a crescent strip around the center of each dog. Place spider dogs on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 11 minutes. Dip a chopstick into some ketchup and dot 'eyes' onto each spider. Serve with remaining ketchup.</li>
            </ol>
