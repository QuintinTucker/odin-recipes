            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 Eggs</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Â¼ Teaspoon Dijon Mustard</li>
                <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Pepper to Taste</li>
                <li>12 Black Olives</li>
                <li>1 Pinch Paprika (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.</li>
                <li>Cut each egg in half lengthwise, remove the yolks, and place the yolks in a bowl with the mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and pepper. Mash the yolks and stir the mixture until smooth and thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Fill each egg half with the deviled yolk mixture using a spoon, piping bag, or a sturdy plastic bag with a corner cut off.</li>
                <li>Cut olives in half and place 1 half on each filled egg as the spider body. Cut the other olive half into 4 strips. Cut each strip in half, so you end up with 8 thin olive pieces for the legs. Arrange 4 olive legs on each side of the spider body. Dust with paprika.</li>
            </ol>
